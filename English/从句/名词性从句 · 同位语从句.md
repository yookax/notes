#### 名词性从句
将简单句中的名词性成分（主语，表语，宾语）用一个句子代替，就叫名词性从句。  
对于 It doesn't matter. 这句，下面用从句代替It。
- [He is a transsexual.] doesn't matter.  
↓加连词  
==That== he is a transsexual doesn't matter.  
- [Is he a transsexual?] doesn't matter.  
↓加连词  
==Whether== he is a transsexual doesn't matter.
- [What is he?] doesn't matter.  
↓加连词  
==What== he is a transsexual doesn't matter.    
#### 独立句子变从句的步骤
1. 调语序。存在倒装语序的，必须调整为陈述语序。
2. 加连词。从句必须由相应的连词来引导。
    - 陈述句用that。
    - 一般疑问句用whether。
    - 特殊疑问句用原本的疑问词作为连词。
1. 把连词置于从句的句首。
#### 同位语
同位语：针对抽象名词的名词性解释说明。  
Michael, ==my friend==, js a good guy. 
#### 同位语从句
同位语从句：充当解释说明作用的名词性从句。  
The fact, ==that she said==, disappointed everyone.  
I have no idea ==what has happened to him==.

#### 形式主语的问题
英语的一个原则，end weight. 句末重心，头轻尾重。  
==正确== <u>That Sally is a beautiful</u> is true.  
==更好== It is true <u>that Sally is beautiful</u>.
#### 形式宾语的问题
==正确== I find it unbelievable <u>that Sally is beautiful</u>.  
==错误== I find <u>that Sally is beautiful</u> unbelievable.
